# Connect Four
## Description
This is an implementation of Connect four written for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)  
The project is written entirely in Ruby and uses Rspec to run tests on its various functions. The board and symbols are
displayed using unicode characters

## Challenges
This project was meant as a way to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD). I found it very difficult to write tests before writing 
the actual code. I didn't know where to start from and how to structure the whole process.  
While I eventually settled on a system, I did not like it - It felt clunky. I hope that moving forward, my mindset and workflow 
would improve to the point where such things come naturally to me

## Set-Up

* Alternatively, you could run it locally
